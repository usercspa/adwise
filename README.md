Introduction:
Getting an insiders' view in an industry or company would be very helpful in landing our dream job. When talking to insiders, we could gain a range of information from necessary skillsets for the job, expectations to company culture.  

However, not everyone has the resources or opportunity to get in touch with insiders in an industry/ company.  

Inspired by "things I wish I knew when I started my career in ___", I would like to build a web app to gather career advice across industries.  

<input type="submit" onclick="showInput();">

  <script language="JavaScript">

                    document.getElementById("id1").value;
                    document.getElementById("id2").value;
